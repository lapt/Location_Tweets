60012584295874560***,***@EarthActivists Good point, but losing the diversity of food products such as meat and dairy could make our species vulnerable to extinction
60012240346152960***,***@EarthActivists Who grows and sells them...corporations. They will find a way to mass produce it for cheap and make it unhealthy

60011086581202946***,***@EarthActivists I'm not talking about meat mass production...I was talking about food other than meat and dairy (vegan).
60009744403927040***,***@EarthActivists I am aware.  Not to worry.
60008735069847552***,***@EarthActivists That depends on who is growing/manufacturing the food

60002822757945344***,***@EarthActivists Vegan? I can't see that happening. Why can't people eat meat? We just can't get into a mass production of it
60002508269027329***,***@NataliaRobba @earthactivists Good Question!
59999859733827585***,***@EarthActivists I find that hard to believe. That seems like a general stereotype that isn't fair for many people
59999532397760512***,***@EarthActivists that would be an interesting concept and may work as people are making health choices and eating more vegetable based meals
59998553275240448***,***@EarthActivists I believe we were discussing the Cove and the hunt taking place in Taiji. That is why I say Japan
59998039284252672***,***@EarthActivists I can see your point but where else are we suppose to get our meat? It's hypocritical, but meat is a staple many countries
59997673763250176***,***@EarthActivists am saying that most of  marine mammal meat that is hunted in Japan is sold in Japan. So education should target the people
59996904204935168***,***@MrHolise I agree 100%! it's a tragedy that is beyond tragedies. I can't even imagine what people are going through in Japan. Thx for link

59995932745408513***,***@EarthActivists true, but the action needs to come from the Japanese people. They are the ones buying the meat. They need to be aware...
